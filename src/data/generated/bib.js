        "abstract": "Anomaly detection can ensure the operational integrity of control systems by identifying issues such as faulty sensors and false data injection attacks. At the same time, we need privacy to protect personal data and limit the information attackers can get about the operation of a system. However, anomaly detection and privacy can sometimes be at odds, as monitoring the system\u2019s behavior is impeded by data hiding. Cryptographic tools such as garbled circuits and homomorphic encryption can help, but each of these is best suited for certain different types of computation. Control with anomaly detection requires both types of computations so a naive cryptographic implementation might be inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose and implement protocols for privacypreserving anomaly detection in a linear control system using garbled circuits, homomorphic encryption, and a combination of the two. In doing so, we show how to distribute private computations between the system and the controller to reduce the amount of computation\u2013in particular at the low-power system. Finally, we systematically compare our proposed protocols in terms of precision, computation, and communication costs.",

        "abstract": "Oblivious transfer (OT) is one of the most fundamental primitives in cryptography and is widely used in protocols for secure two-party and multi-party computation. As secure computation becomes more practical, the need for practical large-scale OT protocols is becoming more evident. OT extensions are protocols that enable a relatively small number of \u201cbase-OTs\u201d to be utilized to compute a very large number of OTs at low cost. In the semi-honest setting, Ishai et al. (Advances in cryptology\u2014 CRYPTO\u201903, vol 2729 of LNCS, Springer, 2003) presented an OT extension protocol for which the cost of each OT (beyond the base-OTs) is just a few hash function operations. In the malicious setting, Nielsen et al. (Advances in cryptology\u2014CRYPTO\u201912, vol 7417 of LNCS, Springer, 2012) presented an efficient OT extension protocol for the setting of malicious adversaries that is secure in a random oracle model. In this work, we improve OT extensions with respect to communication complexity, computation complexity, and scalability in the semi-honest, covert, and malicious model. Furthermore, we show how to modify our maliciously secure OT extension protocol to achieve security with respect to a version of correlation robustness instead of the random oracle. We also provide specific optimizations of OT extensions that are tailored to the use of OT in various secure computation protocols such as Yao\u2019s garbled circuits and the protocol of Goldreich\u2013Micali\u2013Wigderson, which reduce the communication complexity even further.We experimentally verify the efficiency gains of our protocols and optimizations.",

        "abstract": "Publicly accessible databases are an indispensable resource for retrieving up-to-date information. But they also pose a significant risk to the privacy of the user, since a curious database operator can follow the user\u2019s queries and infer what the user is after. Indeed, in cases where the users\u2019 intentions are to be kept secret, users are often cautious about accessing the database. It can be shown that when accessing a single database, to completely guarantee the privacy of the user, the whole database should be down-loaded; namely n bits should be communicated (where n is the number of bits in the database). In this work, we investigate whether by replicating the database, more efficient solutions to the private retrieval problem can be obtained. We describe schemes that enable a user to access k replicated copies of a database (k >",

For lists of length k, we obtain O(k) communication overhead and O(k ln ln k) computation. The protocol for the semihonest environment is secure in the standard model, while the protocol for the malicious environment is secure in the random oracle model. We also consider the problem of approximating the size of the intersection, show a linear lower-bound for the communication overhead of solving this problem, and provide a suitable secure protocol. Lastly, we investigate other variants of the matching problem, including extending the protocol to the multi-party setting as well as considering the problem of approximate matching.",

These optimisations are analysed both theoretically and empirically, using experiments of various adversarial situations.

        "abstract": "Oblivious transfer (OT) protocol is an essential tool in cryptography that provides a wide range of applications such as secure multi-party computation, private information retrieval, private set intersection, contract signing, and privacy-preserving location-based services. The OT protocol has different variants such as oneout- of-2, one-out-of-n, k-out-of-n, andOT extension. In theOT (one-out-of-2, one-out-of-n, andOT extension) protocol, the sender has a set of messages, whereas the receiver has a key. The receiver sends that key to the sender in a secure way; the sender cannot get any information about the received key. The sender encrypts every message by operating on every message using the received key and sends all the encrypted messages to the receiver. The receiver is able to extract only the required message using his key. However, in the kout- of-n OT protocol, the receiver sends a set of k keys to the sender, and in replay, the sender sends all the encrypted messages. The receiver uses his keys and extracts the required messages, but it cannot gain any information about the messages that it has not requested. Generally, the OT protocol requires high communication and computation cost if we transfer millions of oblivious messages. The OT extension protocol provides a solution for this, where the receiver transfers a set of keys to the sender by executing a few numbers of OT protocols. Then, the sender encrypts all the messages using cheap symmetric key cryptography with the help of a received set of keys and transfers millions of oblivious messages to the receiver. In this work, we present different variants of OT protocols such as one-out-of-2, one-out-of-n, k-out-of-n, and OT extension. Furthermore, we cover various aspects of theoretical security guarantees such as semi-honest and malicious adversaries, universally composable, used techniques, computation, and communication efficiency aspects. From the analysis, we found that the semi-honest adversary-based OT protocols required low communication and computation costs as compared to malicious adversary-based OT protocols.",

        "abstract": "The well-known classical constructions of garbled circuits use four ciphertexts per gate, although various methods have been proposed to reduce this cost. The best previously known methods for optimizing AND gates (two ciphertexts; Pinkas et al., ASIACRYPT 2009) and XOR gates (zero ciphertexts; Kolesnikov and Schneider, ICALP 2008) were incompatible, so most implementations used the best known method compatible with free-XOR gates (three ciphertexts; Kolesnikov and Schneider, ICALP 2008). In this work we show how to simultaneously garble AND gates using two ciphertexts and XOR gates using zero ciphertexts, resulting in smaller garbled circuits than any prior scheme. The main idea behind our construction is to break an AND gate into two half-gates \u2014 AND gates for which one party knows one input. Each half-gate can be garbled with a single ciphertext, so our construction uses two ciphertexts for each AND gate while being compatible with free-XOR gates. The price for the reduction in size is that the evaluator must perform two cryptographic operations per AND gate, rather than one as in previous schemes. We experimentally demonstrate that our garbling scheme leads to an overall decrease in time (up to 25%), bandwidth (up to 33%), and energy use (up to 20%) over several benchmark applications.We show that our construction is optimal for a large class of garbling schemes encompassing all known practical garbling techniques.",
