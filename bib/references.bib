private datasets of two parties, where the datasets contain lists of elements
taken from a large domain. This problem has many applications
for online collaboration. We present protocols, based on the use of homomorphic
encryption and balanced hashing, for both semi-honest and
malicious environments. For lists of length k, we obtain O(k) communication
overhead and O(k ln ln k) computation. The protocol for the semihonest
environment is secure in the standard model, while the protocol
for the malicious environment is secure in the random oracle model. We
also consider the problem of approximating the size of the intersection,
show a linear lower-bound for the communication overhead of solving
this problem, and provide a suitable secure protocol. Lastly, we investigate
other variants of the matching problem, including extending the
protocol to the multi-party setting as well as considering the problem of
approximate matching.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we introduce a new tool for controlling the knowledge
transfer process in cryptographic protocol design. It is
applied to solve a general class of problems which include most
of the two-party cryptographic problems in the literature.
Specifically, we show how two parties A and B can interactively generate a random integer N =p.q such that its secret, i.e., the
prime factors (p, q), is hidden from either party individually but
is recoverable jointly if desired. This can be utilized to give a
protocol for two parties with private values i and j to compute
any polynomially computable functions f(i,j) and g(i,j) with
minimal knowledge transfer and a strong fairness property. As
a special case, A and B can exchange a pair of secrets SA, SB,
e.g. the factorization of an integer and a Hamiltonian circuit in
a graph, in such a way that SA becomes computable by B when
and only when SB becomes computable by A. All these results
are proved assuming only that the problem of factoring large
intergers is computationally intractable.},

@article{Chor1998Private,
  abstract  = {Publicly accessible databases are an indispensable resource for retrieving up-to-date information. But they also pose a significant risk to the privacy of the user, since a curious database operator can follow the user’s queries and infer what the user is after. Indeed, in cases where the users’ intentions are to be kept secret, users are often cautious about accessing the database. It can be shown that when accessing a single database, to completely guarantee the privacy of the user, the whole database should be down-loaded; namely n bits should be communicated (where n is the number of bits in the database). In this work, we investigate whether by replicating the database, more efficient solutions to the private retrieval problem can be obtained. We describe schemes that enable a user to access k replicated copies of a database (k >= 2) and privately retrieve information stored in the database. This means that each individual server (holding a replicated copy of the database) gets no information on the identity of the item retrieved by the user. Our schemes use the replication to gain substantial saving. In particular, we present a two-server scheme with communication complexity O(n^(1/3)).},

cryptographic community for a number of years. Until recently it has

@article{Alexandru2023Private,
  abstract  = {Anomaly detection can ensure the operational integrity
of control systems by identifying issues such as faulty
sensors and false data injection attacks. At the same time, we
need privacy to protect personal data and limit the information
attackers can get about the operation of a system. However,
anomaly detection and privacy can sometimes be at odds, as
monitoring the system’s behavior is impeded by data hiding.
Cryptographic tools such as garbled circuits and homomorphic
encryption can help, but each of these is best suited for
certain different types of computation. Control with anomaly
detection requires both types of computations so a naive cryptographic
implementation might be inefficient. To address these
challenges, we propose and implement protocols for privacypreserving
anomaly detection in a linear control system using
garbled circuits, homomorphic encryption, and a combination
of the two. In doing so, we show how to distribute private computations
between the system and the controller to reduce the
amount of computation–in particular at the low-power system.
Finally, we systematically compare our proposed protocols in
terms of precision, computation, and communication costs.},

@article{Zahur2015Two,
  abstract  = {The well-known classical constructions of garbled circuits
use four ciphertexts per gate, although various methods have been proposed
to reduce this cost. The best previously known methods for optimizing
AND gates (two ciphertexts; Pinkas et al., ASIACRYPT 2009)
and XOR gates (zero ciphertexts; Kolesnikov and Schneider, ICALP
2008) were incompatible, so most implementations used the best known
method compatible with free-XOR gates (three ciphertexts; Kolesnikov
and Schneider, ICALP 2008). In this work we show how to simultaneously
garble AND gates using two ciphertexts and XOR gates using zero
ciphertexts, resulting in smaller garbled circuits than any prior scheme.
The main idea behind our construction is to break an AND gate into
two half-gates — AND gates for which one party knows one input. Each
half-gate can be garbled with a single ciphertext, so our construction
uses two ciphertexts for each AND gate while being compatible with
free-XOR gates. The price for the reduction in size is that the evaluator
must perform two cryptographic operations per AND gate, rather than
one as in previous schemes. We experimentally demonstrate that our
garbling scheme leads to an overall decrease in time (up to 25%), bandwidth
(up to 33%), and energy use (up to 20%) over several benchmark
applications.We show that our construction is optimal for a large class of
garbling schemes encompassing all known practical garbling techniques.},

@article{Asharov2017More,
  abstract  = {Oblivious transfer (OT) is one of the most fundamental primitives in cryptography
and is widely used in protocols for secure two-party and multi-party computation.
As secure computation becomes more practical, the need for practical large-scale
OT protocols is becoming more evident. OT extensions are protocols that enable a
relatively small number of “base-OTs” to be utilized to compute a very large number
of OTs at low cost. In the semi-honest setting, Ishai et al. (Advances in cryptology—
CRYPTO’03, vol 2729 of LNCS, Springer, 2003) presented an OT extension protocol
for which the cost of each OT (beyond the base-OTs) is just a few hash function operations.
In the malicious setting, Nielsen et al. (Advances in cryptology—CRYPTO’12,
vol 7417 of LNCS, Springer, 2012) presented an efficient OT extension protocol for the
setting of malicious adversaries that is secure in a random oracle model. In this work,
we improve OT extensions with respect to communication complexity, computation
complexity, and scalability in the semi-honest, covert, and malicious model. Furthermore,
we show how to modify our maliciously secure OT extension protocol to achieve
security with respect to a version of correlation robustness instead of the random oracle.
We also provide specific optimizations of OT extensions that are tailored to the
use of OT in various secure computation protocols such as Yao’s garbled circuits and
the protocol of Goldreich–Micali–Wigderson, which reduce the communication complexity 
even further.We experimentally verify the efficiency gains of our protocols and
optimizations.},

  abstract  = {Oblivious transfer (OT) protocol is an essential tool in cryptography that provides a wide range of applications
such as secure multi-party computation, private information retrieval, private set intersection, contract
signing, and privacy-preserving location-based services. The OT protocol has different variants such as oneout-
of-2, one-out-of-n, k-out-of-n, andOT extension. In theOT (one-out-of-2, one-out-of-n, andOT extension)
protocol, the sender has a set of messages, whereas the receiver has a key. The receiver sends that key to the
sender in a secure way; the sender cannot get any information about the received key. The sender encrypts
every message by operating on every message using the received key and sends all the encrypted messages
to the receiver. The receiver is able to extract only the required message using his key. However, in the kout-
of-n OT protocol, the receiver sends a set of k keys to the sender, and in replay, the sender sends all
the encrypted messages. The receiver uses his keys and extracts the required messages, but it cannot gain
any information about the messages that it has not requested. Generally, the OT protocol requires high communication
and computation cost if we transfer millions of oblivious messages. The OT extension protocol
provides a solution for this, where the receiver transfers a set of keys to the sender by executing a few numbers
of OT protocols. Then, the sender encrypts all the messages using cheap symmetric key cryptography
with the help of a received set of keys and transfers millions of oblivious messages to the receiver. In this
work, we present different variants of OT protocols such as one-out-of-2, one-out-of-n, k-out-of-n, and OT
extension. Furthermore, we cover various aspects of theoretical security guarantees such as semi-honest and
malicious adversaries, universally composable, used techniques, computation, and communication efficiency
aspects. From the analysis, we found that the semi-honest adversary-based OT protocols required low communication
and computation costs as compared to malicious adversary-based OT protocols.},
